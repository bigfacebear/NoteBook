# Ch2 Application Layer

## 1. Principles of Network Applications

### 1. Network Application Architectures

- client-server architecture
- peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture

### 2. Processes Communicating

#### Client and Server Processes

In the context of a communication session between a pair of processes, the process that initiates the communication (that is, initially contacts the other process at the beginning of the session) is labeled as the **client**. The process that waits to be contacted to begin the session is the **server**.

#### The Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network

A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a **socket**.

#### Addressing Processes

- IP address
- port number
